Azure Lighthouse provides capabilities to perform cross-tenant management at scale.  We do this by providing you the ability to view and manage multiple customers from a single context. When you log into Azure, you can see all of your customers who you are managing through Azure Lighthouse. [Learn more](https://azure.com/lighthouse).

This repository contains samples to help you use Azure Resource Manager to configure [Azure delegated resource management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/lighthouse/concepts/azure-delegated-resource-management) and to configure monitoring and management of customer environments.

The templates shown below can be used to [onboard a customer to Azure Lighthouse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lighthouse/how-to/onboard-customer). You can deploy these manually, or use the "Deploy to Azure" buttons to deploy directly in the Azure portal.
